# What To Do I'm Bored

A slot-machine-style activity picker to help you and your partner choose something fun to do — sometimes with your puppy Bernie.

**Live:** https://jeff-is-working.github.io/what-to-do-im-bored/

## How It Works

1. Set how much time you have (1 hour to 1 week)
2. Hit **SPIN!** to randomize two reels: **WHERE** and **WHAT**
3. Get a fun combo like "Let's go stargazing at the lake!"
4. Share the result via iMessage or text

## Features

- 18 locations and 34 activities with slot machine spinning animation
- Time slider filters activities by duration
- Movie activity suggests a specific film to watch
- Bernie-friendly activities are marked with a paw print
- Web Share API for native sharing on iPhone, SMS fallback elsewhere
- Mobile-first design
